<h1>My name is Nathan Moxey, am from the bahamas and worked in the live show production industry for 3 years as a stage or onsight audio and visual technician. Born and raised
in our land i was born on the 4th of july 1999 and and finish highschool in 2018 from Aquinas college. Through the time after finishing my schooling is when i came upon the show 
production industry and caught my eye with a fire passion but i wondered if i cant implement the learnings from this program to be a well rounded technician in various areas. I 
came from a two parent home consisting of a mother and father but myself being the only child and would like to get better at learning the new challenges faced in my way.</h1>
